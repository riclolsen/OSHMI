QUICKSTART:

To quickly run the system after installed, open the OSHMI desktop folder and:

  - On the OSHMI desktop folder: execute _Start_OSHMI.
 OR 
  - Execute the "Webserver" program.
  - Next open the Screen Viewer and the Events Viewer using the icons on the OSHMI folder.
 OR
  - Execute the "HMIShell" program.
  - Next open the Screen Viewer and the Events Viewer using the HMIShell.

The default password for HMIShell is "oshmi".

The system is preconfigured to run a simulation with an example point list and screens.
To simulate a command, click on a breaker and push the "Command" button then choose an action like "open" or "close" and push the action button.
To stop the system click on the "Stop_All" icon in the OSHMI folder.
To edit and create new SVG screens, use the customized Inkscape+SAGE (shortucut in the OSHMI folder). 
Screens are in "c:\oshmi\svg\".
OSHMI configuration files are in "c:\oshmi\conf\".
For more info about configuration please read the OSHMI Configuration Manual.

By default, the system is configured to allow access only by the local machine.
To allow other IP addresses edit the "c:\oshmi\conf\nginx_access_control.conf" file.
